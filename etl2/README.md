# ETL Usage

#### 1. Make sure you're in a virtual environment and have all the requirements installed:

```
virtualenv venv --python=python3.10
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Run the ETL script. The script will guide you through its usage:

```
python etl.py
```

That's it!
